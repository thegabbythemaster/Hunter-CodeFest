Description

Our goal of this game is to achieve the 
social good of helping to aid our planet 
Earth’s climate to be better. We also 
wanted to have this game be targeted to a 
kid friendly audience where they will be 
educated on the energytypes and climate 
types and understand what is normal for a 
climate to be. And we also implemented a 
game setting where they will be tested to 
choose environmentally safe ways to run a 
city or help a climate. If they don’t pick 
the right choices, it’s game over.
